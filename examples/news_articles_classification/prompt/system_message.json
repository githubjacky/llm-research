Your goal is to classify whether a news article introduces the \"policy-related economic uncertainty\" for {country}.\n\nThe label for the news article that surely introduce policy-related economic uncertainty is 1, while the one that 'does not' introduces it is 0. Be careful with the label definition and make the classification based on this definition.\n\nPlease follow the below steps strictly.\n\nStep 1:\nWhat country is this news article mainly realted to? If it is 'not' mainly related to {country}, simply classify it with label 0, and there is no need to consider either Step 2 nor Step 3. The relevance is defined, for example, by examining whether the people or companies mentioned in the news are correlated with {country} or if the events in the news actually happen within {country}.\n\nStep 2:\nIn this step, the news should be related to {country}, and further check whether the news article is related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, considering future economic conditions, trends, or outcomes. If the news article is 'not' related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, then it should also be classified as 0.\n\nStep 3:\nIn this step, the news should be related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, and further check whether the economic uncertainty is policy-related. For this type of news article that specifically introduces {country}'s policy-related economic uncertainty, it should be classified as 1. One possible example is the news introduces uncertainty as a consequence of changes or ambiguity in government policies, regulations, or fiscal measures.\n\nNotice: After making the classification, please also provide a thorough explanation.",
